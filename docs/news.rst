The first Oktoberfest release is ready! :small:`2023-06-25`
-----------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.3.0 is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/oktoberfest/>`_.

We are happy to announce that our first standalone version of Oktoberfest is finally ready.
Besides a lot of bugfixes, new features and performance enhancements over the existing online Prosit service at `ProteomicsDB <https://proteomicsdb.org/prosit>`_, the Oktoberfest codebase is now open source and available on `GitHub <https://github.com/wilhelm-lab/oktoberfest>`_.
In addition, we switched to our new online prediction service `koina <https://koina.proteomicsdb.org>`_ which allows connecting Oktoberfest to any public or self-hosted koina instance for easy prediction model integration and being independent of ProteomicsDB!
